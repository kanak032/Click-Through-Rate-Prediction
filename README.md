# Click-Through-Rate-Prediction

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a user is likely to click on an ad based on their data. The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

Features
- User Input: Users can input features like time spent on the site, age, area income, and daily internet usage through the sidebar.
- Model Selection: Users can choose from four different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM) to make predictions.
- Prediction Output: The app will predict whether the user will click on an ad based on the provided input and selected model.
